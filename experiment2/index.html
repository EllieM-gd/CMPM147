				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>In this experiment I attempted to recreate a picture of palm trees on a beach during a sunset. I use a lot of randomness to generate the picture so that the tree position, sand, ocean, and sunset look different every time.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The code first determines the size of the beach and places pixels with 1 of 4 colors in the designated area to create the beach. I do something similar, except its all one random blue color, for the ocean above it. I also use this time to generate a random amount of waves inside the ocean. I then lastly generate a random gradient background and use that for the sky color. After this I update the pixels on the canvas and move on to the sun which is a slightly random eclipse that appears on the left or right of the screen. Then clouds are created in front of it. The clouds are a bunch of eclipses that are supposed to be grey on the bottom and be a similar color to the sky behind them on top. Lastly I create palm trees on the beach which is just a thick line, with a trapezoid on the bottom, some coconuts and leaves that are rotated around the tip and the bottom ones are more brown like my reference photo.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I'm pretty proud of this project, even though it looks very simple I had a lot of fun making it. I think I was able to capture a small essence of the original photo I was basing this off of.</p>
